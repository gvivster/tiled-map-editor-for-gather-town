# tiled-map-editor-for-gather-town
This is a repo for files used in the tutorials I run about creating maps in Tiled Map Editor specifically for Gather.town. I run these tutorials in Gather.town's community-run Discord server: https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6

(Tiled Map Editor is also used to design real game levels, so it's a pretty cool skill to have!)

**Here's how to get started!**

1) Download and install Tiled Map Editor (it's free!): https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled 

2) Download this repo. (Not familiar with Github? On the main page of "tiled-map-editor-for-gather-town", click the green button that says "Code" and select "Download ZIP". Congrats, you did it!)
It contains Gather.town assets and a template set up for an easy start. 

3) Make a folder somewhere you like for Tiled projects. Put this folder inside it. Unzip it (you probably knew that part).

3) Open "tinybeach.tmx". A few tilesets should open with it. Edit to your heart's content!  

4) To see a list of Tiled keyboard shortcuts and continually-updated tips, go to this Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCJBVXbYxMeJrD0LvIRJTkXi95Uz5t9Fg_7Aoinoabc/edit

5) You'll learn to add more tilesets in steps 9-11 - but do at least step 6 and 7 first. Actually walking around your space will virtually (ha) always give you useful insights that you won't get just by building it.

6) Finished building the first version of your map? Let's get it ready to upload! Go to File -> Export As Image. This will give you a PNG, which will be your "background".
  - Optional: Want items that players can walk underneath in your Gather space? Hide all of the layers except for the ones that contain those items, and export that as a separate image. That will be your "Foreground".

7) You're ready to upload your first map to Gather.town!! ðŸ¥³ See this helpful run-down in Gather's Help Center: https://support.gather.town/help/background-foreground-overview

8) Optional: Want to upload your map to a shared community Gather space? You can do that too! https://app.gather.town/app/QyWZY5n5n3rR6zwl/GVGuide%20Open%20Edit%20Sandbox
To get build privileges in my Open Edit Sandbox space, join the Gather.town Discord server and message Evie (me): https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6

9) Want to dip your toe into adding a few more tilesets? There are some more Gather tilesets included in the folder you downloaded. Look in the "Tilesets" folder and open .tsx files in it. (Just don't move that folder, or move anything out of it, or you'll have to manually re-browse for the files inside Tiled. Not a huge deal, just annoying.)

9) Want to make ANOTHER map that uses the tilesets that are currently open? Go to New -> New Map. Make sure your new map is Orthogonal and that the tile size and width is 32x32 px.

10) Want to start finding different tilesets? Awesome! There are so many out there! Itch.io is a great place to start looking for tilesets. Many of them are even free. You can find a couple libraries of them here: https://gvguide.itch.io/
Make sure any tilsets you use are:
  - 32x32 (because this is the size of Gather.town's grid)
  - Top-down/RPG (not platformer/side-scroller)
  - That the creator says explicitly that they are **available for commercial use** (to keep your mind at ease that you'll never run into legal issues using the tilesets)
  - That the creator **does NOT say that they must be used in RPGMaker** or another specific engine

11) Curious how to actually use the tilesets you download? In most cases, you'll download tilesets as PNGs. To create a Tiled tileset from a PNG: In Tiled, go to New -> New Tileset. Make sure it's 32x32 px, and make sure you "browse" and save it in a place you want the file to live. (Remember, if you move the PNG or tileset .tsx later, you'll have to manually reconnect it inside Tiled.)
