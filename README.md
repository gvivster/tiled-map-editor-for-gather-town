# tiled-map-editor-for-gather-town
This is a repo for files used in the tutorials I run about creating maps in Tiled Map Editor specifically for Gather.town. I run these tutorials in Gather.town's community-run Discord server: https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6

(Tiled Map Editor is also used to design real game levels, so it's a pretty cool skill to have!)

Getting started? Here are the steps:

1) Download Tiled Map Editor (it's free!): https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled 

2) Download the Tiny Meeting Beach .zip file, which contains Gather.town assets and a template.

3) Edit the template to your heart's content!

4) To see a list of keyboard shortcuts and continually-updated tips, go to this Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCJBVXbYxMeJrD0LvIRJTkXi95Uz5t9Fg_7Aoinoabc/edit

5) You can add more tilesets to your map by opening one of the other .tsx files in the "Tilesets" folder.

6) When you're finished, go to File -> Export As Image. If you want items that players can walk underneath, hide all of the layers except for those items, and export that as a separate image.

7) Want to upload your island to Gather.town? See this helpful run-down in Gather's Help Center: https://support.gather.town/help/background-foreground-overview

8) Want to upload it to a shared community space? You can do that too! Here is an Open Edit Sandbox: https://app.gather.town/app/QyWZY5n5n3rR6zwl/GVGuide%20Open%20Edit%20Sandbox
To get build privileges, join the Gather.town Discord server and message Evie (me)! https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6
